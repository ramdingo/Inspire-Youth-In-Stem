            The world is my oyster hence I choose to explore new sets of skills that are essensial for my growth.
            This is my first of many websites that I have developed and has become my interest as it is fun and easy to learn.
            I completed my highschool and joined a Youth programe that teaches the youth the fundamentals in choosing a career as well as the basics of coding and
            website development. I am a very physical being as i like moving up and down while getting things done correctly. Self-acknowledgement is important,
            that is why i believe that I am a good leader driven only by success and credit for.
